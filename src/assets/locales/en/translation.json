These symptoms can last for days. </1> <2> A small proportion of people who are infected develop more severe difficulties in breathing, requiring hospitalisation and help breathing with oxygen, medication, or a ventilator. </2> <3> We currently do not understand why people respond to the virus differently.

      "a2": "Yes. This would mean that at the time you were tested initially you either were not infected, the nasal swab was not taken properly, or that there was not enough virus in your nose to detect it. The second PCR test detected the presence of the virus, and that means the infection was/is active at the time of the second test. ",
